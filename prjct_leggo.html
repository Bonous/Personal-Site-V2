            <h2 class="project-blog-subtitle">Background:</h2>
            <p class="project-blog-normal-text">Leggo is a prototype of a quadrupedal leg that I made as my grade 12 tech project. This year due to quadmesters, I had barely over a month of school time to complete this project. Because of the little time I was forced to sacrifice some aspects of the project.</p>
            <br>
            
            <!-- Paragraph Example -->
            <h2 class="project-blog-subtitle">Design:</h2>
            <p class="project-blog-normal-text">I took inspiration from the co-axial mechanism used on Stanford's quadrupedal robot Doggo. The leg uses 2 stepper motors to drive the end effector. Ideally, I would have used brushless motors with encoders but due to time and budget constraints I had to use stepper motors. The leg is entirely 3d printed with the exception of basic hardware.</p>
            <br>

            <!-- Paragraph Example -->
            <h2 class="project-blog-subtitle">CAD & 3d Printing:</h2>
            <p class="project-blog-normal-text">I have experience in both these fields through FIRST Robotics and other side projects so I was least worried about it. I used SolidWorks for CAD and parts were printed on my Prusa I3 Mk3.</p>

            <!-- Paragraph Example -->
            <h2 class="project-blog-subtitle">Code:</h2>
            <p class="project-blog-normal-text">The code for Leggo was written in the Arduino IDE using the Arduino C++ variant. The final code for Leggo's walk gait uses angles stored in arrays that were calculated using inverse kinematics and trig. from cartesian coordinates.</p>

            <!-- Paragraph Example -->
            <h2 class="project-blog-subtitle">Electronics:</h2>
            <p class="project-blog-normal-text">The electronic portion of this project was pretty simple. I used an Arduino Uno microcontroller along with 2 stepper motor driver boards to control the motors. No encoders were used because I did not have any available at the time.</p>
